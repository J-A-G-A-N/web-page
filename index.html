                additional Information</h1>
                <p>Recently, the Indian government faced significant
                pressure as the country experienced its largest protest
                concerning new farm laws. Farmers from various states
                across northern India united to voice their concerns,
                utilizing platforms like Twitter to spread their
                message.</p>
                <p>Twitter, in particular, came under severe pressure
                from the Indian government to remove accounts and
                hashtags that were perceived to defame the government.
                In February 2021, Twitter temporarily withheld several
                accounts, including those of journalists, news agencies,
                and even celebrities, citing Indian laws on incitement
                and national security.</p>
                <p>This action sparked widespread controversy regarding
                freedom of speech in the country. Critics argue that
                these large tech platforms yielded to significant
                political pressure from the government under the guise
                of national security.</p>
                <p>The question arises: Should platforms prioritize
                compliance with local laws—even when this limits
                speech—or should they protect global standards of free
                expression? The farmers’ protest illustrates how
                moderation policies are not always applied consistently
                and can be influenced by the demands of powerful
                states.</p>
